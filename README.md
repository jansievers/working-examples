# Working examples by Jan-Christoph Sievers
This website provides an overview about my work in the issues Frontend-Development, Graphics / Screendesign and Demo Scene.

Featured tools and libraries
----------------------------
* Grunt
* HAML
* SASS
* jQuery
* Fancybox

This website should work fine in modern browsers. No old IE supported - sorry ;)
Optimization for mobile devices is not finished yet.

Have fun: http://www.jan-christoph-sievers.de/working-examples/
